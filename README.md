# DeltaRedis

[![Build Status](https://ci.loper.me/job/DeltaRedis/badge/icon)](https://ci.loper.me/job/DeltaRedis)

DeltaRedis uses the in-memory data structure store, [Redis](http://redis.io/), to create a new communication
system for BungeeCord-linked Spigot servers.

BungeeCord uses player connections and special Bukkit/Spigot channels to communicate which makes it heavily dependent on
players. By using DeltaRedis, BungeeCord and servers can communicate, faster and easier, than the provided BungeeCord methods.

# APIs
There are two APIs: 
[Spigot](https://github.com/renay/DeltaRedis/blob/master/src/main/java/com/gmail/tracebachi/DeltaRedis/Spigot/DeltaRedisApi.java)
and
[Bungee](https://github.com/renay/DeltaRedis/blob/master/src/main/java/com/gmail/tracebachi/DeltaRedis/Bungee/DeltaRedisApi.java). 
They are similar in structure and use, but it is important to select the appropriate API depending on where your plugin will run.

## How to include the API with Maven

```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>delta-repo</id>
            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
```

```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.gmail.tracebachi</groupId>
            <artifactId>DeltaRedis</artifactId>
            <version>3.x.x</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

## Using the API Publish System
```java
public void sendHelloToZee() {
  DeltaRedisApi api = DeltaRedisApi.instance();
  
  String serverName = "Creative";
  String channel = "Talk";
  String message = "Hi Zee!";
  
  // Publish the message
  api.publish(serverName, channel, message);
}

// Use the event to listen for messages
@EventHandler
public void onMessage(DeltaRedisMessageEvent event) {
  if(event.getChannel().equals("Talk")) {
    Player player = Bukkit.getPlayerExact("Zee");
    
    if(player != null) {
        player.sendMessage(event.getMessage());
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding a Player with the API 
```java
public void findZee() {
  DeltaRedisApi api = DeltaRedisApi.instance();
  
  api.findPlayer("Zee", (cachedPlayer) -> {
    if(cachedPlayer == null) {
    
      // :( No Zee found
      
    } else {
      
      // Found Zee on server!
      String server = cachedPlayer.getServer();
      
      // Send an announcement to everyone on the network
      api.sendAnnouncementToServer(Servers.SPIGOT, "I found Zee on " + server + "!");
      
      // Ask for a prize
      api.sendMessageToPlayer("Zee", "Do I win?\nWhat's my prize?");
    }
  }
}
```
